# Git-Go

**Git-Go** is a simplified and lightweight `Git` implementation written in **Go**. It replicates key features of `Git`, such as **creating repositories**, **adding files**, **committing changes**, and working with **branches**, **tags**, and **remotes**.

## Features

- Initialize a new Git repository or reinitialize an existing one (`init`)
- Add files to the staging area (`add`)
- Commit changes to the repository (`commit`)
